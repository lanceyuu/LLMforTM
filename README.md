# LLMforTM

Hello, this script is designed to carry out topic modeling specifically for short texts. While it can technically be applied to longer texts as well, limitations on token counts from OpenAI and other large language models make it less practical for that purpose.

I have compared the results of topic modeling using LLMs with LDA, and humans. The results are quite promising. I have uploaded the preprint in JMIR. Please refer to the manuscript. 
You may see the excel file for the human classification. The csv file for GPT classification. The R script for LDA topic modelling.
